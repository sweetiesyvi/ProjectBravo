# Click Click Game
**Date:** October 2025  
**Author:** Sweetie  


## 🕹️ Game Objective
Try to accumulate the highest number of clicks before the timer is up!  
Clicking your mouse, or rather each click, adds a point to your score, and your top score is written down in **Local Storage**.  


## 📜 How to Play
1. Tap on **Click!** to get going.  
2. The 10-second timer starts without delay.  
3. Click as many times as you can—every single click counts for 1 point.  
4. Your final score gets displayed when the time runs out.  
5. Try to beat your **best score** (stored locally)!  

## ⚙️ Features
- Current **ES6 Modules** (`game.js` and `storage.js`)
- **Bootstrap 5 Navbar** with links to Play, How to Play, and Settings
- High scores saved using **Local Storage**
- Use of the **Google Font** is to create a retro game feeling
- **Responsive design** for mobile as well as desktop
- **User-friendly UI** (semantic HTML, visible focus, aria-live updates, etc.)
- **Easter Egg:** Type `themeSwap()` in the console to change the theme!


## 🧩 Tech Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (custom + Bootstrap 5)  
- JavaScript ES Modules  
- Local Storage  
- Google Fonts
